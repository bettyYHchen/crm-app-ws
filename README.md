# crm-app-ws

Modified Jamuna's code with the implementation of multiple roles and teams (binding these two fields into a field called positions). I used manytomany mapping and save the relations in a foreign table. Please change the application.properties files to change the database name to the one you are using. The sql script to initialize the database called initialize.sql is included.
